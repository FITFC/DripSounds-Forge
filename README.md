- Plays water pop sound when a water drop lands
- Adds a new sizzle sound for when a lava drop lands
- Adds the ability to configure the rate of drip particle spawning
- In 1.17+, the sounds for water/lava drips use the Dripstone sounds by default, and there is an option to use the old sounds if desired (like in 1.16)

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.<br>
*(NOTE: If you are not using the dripstone sounds, the custom lava drop sizzle sound only works in multiplayer if the server also has the mod. This will hopefully be fixed in a future version)*

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge) so the config screen works.

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/DripSounds-Forge/releases)

## Usage

Feel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)

The only official downloads are from the DripSounds-Forge GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>
Be careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>
(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)

Other mods shouldn't conflict unless they do weird things with splash particles.

The mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](COPYING)

## Upcoming
idk, feel free to suggest things
