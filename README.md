# WaterDripSound
### Minecraft Forge mod that makes water drops play a sound

![](demo/WaterDripSound_preview.gif)<br>
*(You can't hear this gif, but those drops are totally playing a sound)*

Water drops that fall from the ceiling play a subtle "pop" sound when they hit the ground.
The volume can be changed in the mod config.

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/WaterDripSound/releases)

## Usage

Feel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)

Tested on Forge 31.2.0 with MC 1.15.2, on both singleplayer and multiplayer.

Other mods shouldn't conflict unless they do weird things with splash particles.
