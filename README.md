# WaterDripSound
### Minecraft Forge mod that makes water drops play a sound

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)

## Usage

Feel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)

Tested on Forge 31.2.0 with MC 1.15.2, on both singleplayer and multiplayer.
Other mods shouldn't conflict unless they do weird things with splash particles.
