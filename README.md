# WaterDripSound
### Minecraft Forge mod that makes water drops play a sound

![](demo/WaterDripSound_preview.gif)<br>
*(You can't hear this gif, but those drops are totally playing a sound)*

Water drops that fall from the ceiling play a subtle "pop" sound when they hit the ground.
The volume can be changed in the mod config.

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/WaterDripSound/releases)

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge) so the config screen works.

## Usage

Feel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)

Do not download this mod from anywhere other than the InvMove GitHub page or the InvMove Curseforge page.<br>
This mod may not be reposted to any other third-party websites.<br>
